## Introduction

Welcome to YouTube-to-Chatbot, a Python notebook that allows you to train a chatbot on an entire YouTube channel. 🌟

This repository provides a notebook that utilizes the power of YouTube, OpenAI, Langchain, and Pinecone to build a conversational agent capable of mimicking the content, knowledge, and tone of any YouTube channel. By extracting information from the channel's videos and training a chatbot, we can create an AI-powered assistant that engages in meaningful conversations with users.

2. Obtain API keys for OpenAI, YouTube, and Pinecone.
